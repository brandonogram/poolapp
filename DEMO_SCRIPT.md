## Demo Script

### 1. Opening (1 minute)

**You:** "Hey [Name], thanks for hopping on the call. I've got PoolApp pulled up here and ready to walk you through it."

**If they haven't seen it yet:** "Before we dive in, have you seen PoolApp before or is this your first time looking at it?"

**Then set agenda:** "Here's what I want to show you today - this should only take about 15 minutes. I'll walk through how PoolApp can save you time and money on routes, and if anything's interesting, we can go deeper. Sound good?"

**Get their time:** "Do you have 15 minutes now, or should we schedule a follow-up?"

---

### 2. The Problem We Solve (2 minutes)

**Transition:** "So, I talked to a lot of pool service owners in [City], and the number one thing I hear is route planning takes way too long."

**Paint the picture:** 
- Most owners spend 2-3 hours every night planning routes
- They're manually optimizing - "which customer goes after which"
- Using Excel, Route4Me, or "just know it by heart"

**Connect to their reality:** "How are you handling route planning right now? Are you using spreadsheets, Route4Me, something else?"

**Listen for their answer** - They'll tell you. Acknowledge what they're doing.

**Pivot to solution:** "That's exactly what PoolApp solves. Our AI finds the fastest route based on traffic, job priority, technician availability - all in one click. Instead of spending 2 hours tonight, you spend 5 minutes."

**Key point:** "We typically see companies save 500+ hours per year just on route planning. That's time you could be billing more jobs."

**Check interest:** "Does that resonate with you? Are you tired of losing evenings to spreadsheets?"

---

### 3. The Solution - Live Walkthrough (5 minutes)

**Transition:** "Let me show you how it works. I'm on the dashboard right now - let me walk through it."

**Navigation:** "I'll move to the Schedule page so you can see how route planning works, then we'll look at revenue tracking and alerts."

**Do it:** Navigate to /schedule

**Explain what they're seeing:** "So here on the Schedule page - you're seeing the weekly view. Each row represents a technician, and each cell shows their jobs for the day."

**Point out key features:**

1. **Auto-Optimize Button:** "See that 'Auto-Optimize' button up top? That's our one-click route optimization. You click it, our AI reorders the entire day based on traffic patterns, technician schedules, and job priority. Takes seconds instead of hours."

2. **Revenue Tracking:** "Scrolling down to the dashboard - see 'Today's Revenue' and 'This Month'? That's real-time. Every job shows up instantly. No more lost jobs, no more guessing what you're making."

3. **Chemistry Alerts:** "See that 'Alerts' section on dashboard? 'pH high at Johnson - prevented $500 callback'? That's our chemistry alert system. We catch issues before they become expensive callbacks. You prevent the problem before it happens."

4. **Technician Tracking:** "Back to schedule - each technician card shows their progress for the day. 6/8 pools. You can see who's running behind and auto-adjust their route on the fly."

**Ask for reaction:** "That's the core of it - route planning, revenue tracking, chemistry alerts, technician management, all in one place."

**Pause for impact:** "I want you to think about what that means for your operation. How much time would you save? How many callbacks would you prevent? What's that worth to you?"

---

### 4. ROI - The Money Talk (3 minutes)

**Acknowledge:** "I know you're thinking about the math. Let me break it down with real numbers from companies I've worked with."

**Use their inputs (ask):** "Roughly how many routes are you running right now? And what's your average revenue per service?"

**If they give numbers, do quick math:** "So with [X] routes and an average of $[Y] per job, you're probably doing around $[calc] per month. If PoolApp saves you even 10% on route planning alone, that's $[savings] in your pocket annually."

**Compare to alternatives:** "Route4Me would cost you $150/month plus per-driver fees. PoolApp is $39-$79/month. No per-driver charges, no setup fees, you're up and running in 5 minutes."

**The question:** "At $39/month, if PoolApp saves you 2 hours of planning time every night, doesn't it pay for itself in about a month? And that's before we even talk about the other benefits like callbacks and revenue tracking."

---

### 5. Objections & Closing (3 minutes)

**Pre-empt common objections:**

**Objection 1: "We're happy with our current process."**

Response: "Totally get it. I'm not trying to sell you something you don't need. Here's what I'd suggest - take PoolApp for a spin. Setup takes 5 minutes. Try it for one week on your routes. If you're saving 2+ hours per night, you'll know it within a week. If you like it, great. If not, cancel anytime. You've got nothing to lose."

**Objection 2: "This sounds expensive - we don't have budget for software right now."**

Response: "I hear you. Let me ask - how much is your time worth? If your routes take 2 hours to plan and you're billing say $100/hour for your time, that's $200/night you're spending on planning. PoolApp would cut that to 5 minutes. You'd save $185/night. That's over $5,000 a year. Even if you only run it seasonally, it pays for itself. What's your time worth - $5,000 or $185/night?"

**Objection 3: "I need to talk to my partner/boss before making decisions."**

Response: "Makes perfect sense. PoolApp is a new tool, and you should absolutely involve your team. How about this - I can send you a free 30-day trial account. Your team can use it, you can see exactly how it works, no risk. At the end of 30 days, you'll have data to make a decision. Sound fair?"

**Objection 4: "We use a custom system that works fine."**

Response: "Good to hear. Custom systems can work great until you hit a certain scale. But I'll ask - are you growing? Adding more routes, hiring more techs? Because at that point, spreadsheets and manual planning really start holding you back. PoolApp scales with you - whether you have 5 routes or 50, it's $39-$79/month. No per-driver seat charges. You're not paying per tech."

### 6. The Close (1 minute)

**Assess the call:** "Before we wrap up, I want to make sure I answered everything. Was there anything specific about route planning or revenue tracking that you wanted to see?"

**Get commitment to next step:**

**If they're interested:** "Great! I'd love to set you up with an account. Would you like to do that now? I can get you created in 2 minutes and you'll have full access immediately."

**If they're not interested but want more info:** "No worries at all. Can I email you some materials - maybe the ROI calculator showing your specific numbers, or a comparison sheet vs Route4Me?"

**If they need time:** "Totally understand. How about I email you some resources to review with your team, and we can reconnect in a week or two? Does that work?"

**Final close:** "Appreciate your time today, [Name]. We'll be in touch."

## Tips for Success

**Energy:** Keep it high but grounded. You know this stuff inside and out.

**Listen more than you talk:** The best demos feel like conversations, not presentations.

**Use their data:** When showing the dashboard, reference their specific numbers if you know them.

**Be ready for objections:** They'll ask questions. That's buying behavior. It's good - it means they're interested.

**Speed:** If they're clearly interested, move to setup quickly. If they're hesitant, slow down and address concerns.

**Follow up immediately:** Send account details within 5 minutes of the call while it's fresh.

## Common Scenarios

### "Already using Route4Me, loving it, why switch?"

Response: "Route4Me is great for large fleets. But for 5-15 routes, you're paying per-driver seat fees. PoolApp has no per-driver charges and includes features specifically for pool services - chemistry alerts, revenue tracking. You'd actually save money while getting more functionality. Can I ask - how many technicians do you have and what's your current monthly spend?"

### "Too expensive, can't justify"

Response: "I get it. But let me run the numbers with what you shared. With [X] routes and $[Y] revenue/job, if PoolApp saves you even 2 hours of planning time per month, that's $[savings]. In one year, that's $[annual savings]. The software costs $[monthly cost] annually. So you're saving $[net savings] in the first year alone. After that, it's pure profit. And that's conservative - I'm only counting route planning time, not the callbacks or revenue tracking benefits."

### "Need to talk to partner"

Response: "Totally makes sense. Let me set you up with a free 30-day trial account so your whole team can test it. No commitment, full access. At the end of 30 days, you'll have real data to make a decision. Fair?"

### "We're busy seasonally, don't need year-round"

Response: "Good point - PoolApp works great for seasonal ops too. You can pause your subscription when you're not running routes, then turn it back on when you ramp up. Flexible monthly pricing means you only pay for what you use. And our chemistry alerts are most valuable during peak season when callbacks are expensive."
