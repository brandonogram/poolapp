["active]` state)\n- No modal/dialog appears\n- No page navigation occurs\n- No job is created\n\n**This is base functionality that's completely broken.**\n\n---\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Navigate to https://poolapp-tau.vercel.app/dashboard\n2. Log in with `demo@poolapp.com` / `demo123`\n3. Click the \"Add Job\" button (ref: e106)\n4. Observe: Nothing happens\n\n---\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nClicking \"Add Job", "should:\n- Open a modal dialog to create a new job\n- OR navigate to a job creation page\n- Allow user to select customer, service type, date, technician, etc.\n\n---\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nButton click is registered but nothing happens. User remains on the dashboard with no way to create a new job.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Button Element:**\n- Ref: e106\n- Type: button\n- Location: Dashboard, in the action button bar (with View Routes, New Invoice, Schedule, Customers)\n\n**Snapshot Evidence:**\n- Before click: `button \"Add Job", ["ref=e106] [cursor=pointer]`\n- After click: `button \"Add Job", ["active] [ref=e106] [cursor=pointer]`\n\nThe button state changes to `[active]` but no other UI changes occur.\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\n**High Priority** - This is a core feature:\n- Users cannot create new jobs\n- Field technicians cannot be assigned work\n- Revenue tracking cannot be accurate\n- App is essentially non-functional for daily operations\n\n---\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Likely issues:**\n1. `onClick` handler not connected to any function\n2. Modal component not implemented\n3. Missing job creation API endpoint\n4. Frontend\u8def\u7531 not configured for job creation flow\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**Immediate Fix Required:**\n1. Implement job creation modal/dialog\n2. Wire up button `onClick` handler\n3. Create job creation API endpoint in Supabase\n4. Add form fields: customer, service type, date, time, technician, notes\n5. Test full flow: create job \u2192 assign technician \u2192 appear in schedule/routes\n\n---\n\n## Testing Notes\n\n**What I Tested (and didn't test):**\n- \u2705 Dashboard loads correctly\n- \u2705 Revenue tracking displays\n- \u2705 Route progress shows\n- \u2705 Technician status displays\n- \u2705 Alerts display\n- \u2705 Navigation links work\n- \u2705 Customers page loads with chemistry tracking\n- \u274c \"Add Job\" button - **BROKEN** (no functionality)\n- \u274c \"New Invoice", "button - NOT TESTED\n- \u274c Routes page - NOT TESTED\n- \u274c Schedule page - NOT TESTED\n- \u274c Technicians page - NOT TESTED\n- \u274c Invoices page - NOT TESTED\n\n**Previous Testing Was Incomplete:**\nI only tested navigation and page loads, not button functionality. This was a mistake - core actions should have been tested first.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Fix \"Add Job\" button functionality\n2. Test all other action buttons:\n   - \"New Invoice\"\n   - \"View Routes\"\n   - \"Schedule", 3.0, "Test core workflows:\n   - Create job\n   - Create customer\n   - Create invoice\n   - Assign technician\n   - Complete job\n4. Mobile view testing\n5. End-to-end flow testing\n\n---\n\n**Reported by:** Brandon Bot  \n**Date:** 2025-02-01  \n**Priority:** High - Blocker for production use"]]]
