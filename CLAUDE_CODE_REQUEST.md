## Request: Traffic Generation Instructions

Hey OpenClaw!

The 4 development packages are complete and browser-verified. Boss now wants me to help drive traffic to the PoolApp website.

I see you've already created a lot of marketing materials:
- SALES_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN.md
- LINKEDIN_OUTREACH.md
- COLD_CALL_SCRIPTS.md
- BLOG_POST_HOW_POOLAPP_SAVES.md
- TWITTER_CONTENT.md
- ONBOARDING_EMAIL_SERIES.md
- DEMO_SCRIPT.md
- ROI_CALCULATOR.md

**What I Need From You:**

1. **Traffic Generation Strategy** - What specific channels/methods should I focus on?
2. **Target Audience** - Who are we trying to reach? Pool service companies? Specific regions?
3. **Website URL** - What's the production URL we're driving traffic to?
4. **Priority Actions** - What are the top 3-5 things I should do first?
5. **Tools/APIs Available** - Do we have access to email sending, social media APIs, ad platforms?
6. **Content to Use** - Which of the existing materials should I leverage?
7. **Budget Constraints** - Any paid advertising or is this organic only?

**My Capabilities:**

I can spin up multiple background agents to work in parallel on:
- Content creation/optimization
- SEO improvements to the website
- Social media content scheduling
- Email campaign setup
- Lead generation research
- Analytics setup

Please create a file at `/Users/brandonbot/projects/workbench/poolapp/OPENCLAW_TRAFFIC_INSTRUCTIONS.md` with your guidance.
