["# PoolApp - Customer Feedback System Design\n\n**Date:** 2025-02-01\n**Status:** Ready to build\n\n---\n\n## System Overview\n\n**Goal:** Capture and manage customer feedback from pool cleaning companies before and during cold outreach.\n\n**Problem:** Cold outreach will generate questions, objections, feature requests, and complaints. We need a system to:\n\n1. Track every piece of feedback\n2. Identify patterns (common objections, feature requests)\n3. Prioritize improvements based on volume and revenue impact\n4. Close the loop with customers who provided feedback\n5. Measure the impact of improvements on conversion\n\n---\n\n## Feedback Types\n\n### 1. Outreach Feedback (Pre-Customer)\n\n**When:** During initial LinkedIn/emails/DMs\n\n**Capture:**\n- Pain points they mention (too many spreadsheets, lost routes, techs late)\n- Features they want (map view, mobile app, inventory tracking)\n- Objections (price, complexity, switching cost)\n- Timing (season, budget cycle, decision timeline)\n\n**Example:**\n```\nCustomer: ABC Pool Maintenance\nContact: John Smith, Owner\nDate: 2025-02-01\nSource: LinkedIn DM\nFeedback: \"We have 3 techs doing 15 pools each day. Currently using spreadsheets and GPS. Concerned about switching cost and data migration.\"\n```\n\n### 2. Demo Feedback (Interested)\n\n**When:** After demo or trial signup\n\n**Capture:**\n- Features they tried and liked\n- Features they couldn't find or were confusing\n- Missing functionality for their workflow\n- Technical issues (bugs, performance)\n- Integration needs (QuickBooks, Jobber, etc.)\n\n**Example:**\n```\nCustomer: XYZ Pool Service\nContact: Sarah Johnson, Manager\nDate: 2025-02-05\nSource: Free Trial\nFeedback: \"Love the route optimization! But we need QuickBooks integration for invoicing. Also, the mobile app needs offline mode.\"\n```\n\n### 3. Onboarding Feedback (New Customer)\n\n**When:** First 30 days as paying customer\n\n**Capture:**\n- Time to first value (when did they see ROI? )\n- Onboarding friction points\n- Training gaps\n- Feature adoption rate\n- Churn risk indicators\n\n**Example:**\n```\nCustomer: 123 Pool Co.\nContact: Mike Davis, Owner\nDate: 2025-02-10\nSource: Onboarding Check-in\nFeedback: \"Took 2 weeks to fully implement. Route optimization saved us $400 in the first week!\"\n```\n\n### 4. Ongoing Feedback (Existing Customer)\n\n**When:** Quarterly check-ins or NPS surveys\n\n**Capture:**\n- Feature requests for roadmap\n- Competitive comparison feedback\n- Pricing feedback\n- Support ticket themes\n\n**Example:**\n```\nCustomer: Pool Pros LLC\nContact: Lisa Chen, Operations Manager\nDate: 2025-04-01\nSource: Quarterly Check-in\nFeedback: \"Love the platform. Would love to see inventory tracking for chemicals. Competitor X has this.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Feedback Database Schema\n\n### Table: `feedback_entries`\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE feedback_entries (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),\n  contact_name TEXT NOT NULL,\n  contact_role TEXT,\n  company_name TEXT NOT NULL,\n  email TEXT,\n  phone TEXT,\n  \n  feedback_source TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'linkedin', 'email', 'demo', 'trial', 'onboarding', 'support', 'nps_survey'\n  feedback_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'pain_point', 'feature_request', 'objection', 'bug_report', 'praise'\n  \n  feedback_text TEXT NOT NULL,\n  priority TEXT DEFAULT 'medium', -- 'high', 'medium', 'low'\n  status TEXT DEFAULT 'new', -- 'new', 'reviewed', 'planned', 'in_progress', 'resolved', 'deferred'\n  \n  metadata JSONB, -- {\"team_size\": 5, \"pools_per_day\": 30, \"current_solution\": \"Jobber\"}\n  \n  assigned_to UUID REFERENCES staff(id),\n  resolution_notes TEXT,\n  resolved_at TIMESTAMPTZ,\n  \n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),\n  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()\n);\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_feedback_customer ON feedback_entries(customer_id);\nCREATE INDEX idx_feedback_status ON feedback_entries(status);\nCREATE INDEX idx_feedback_type ON feedback_entries(feedback_type);\nCREATE INDEX idx_feedback_priority ON feedback_entries(priority);\nCREATE INDEX idx_feedback_source ON feedback_entries(feedback_source);\n```\n\n### Table: `feedback_tags`\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE feedback_tags (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  feedback_id UUID REFERENCES feedback_entries(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  tag TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'route_optimization', 'mobile_app', 'pricing', 'integration', 'usability'\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),\n  UNIQUE(feedback_id, tag)\n);\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_tags_feedback ON feedback_tags(feedback_id);\nCREATE INDEX idx_tags_tag ON feedback_tags(tag);\n```\n\n---\n\n## Feedback Capture Workflows\n\n### Workflow 1: LinkedIn Outreach\n\n1. **Send outreach message:**\n   - Template: See `LINKEDIN_OUTREACH_TEMPLATE.md`\n   - Track: Customer in outreach list\n\n2. **Capture response:**\n   - If they reply: Log feedback entry with `source: 'linkedin'`\n   - Tag with: `pain_point`, `objection`, or `feature_request`\n\n3. **Auto-assign:**\n   - Objections: Assign to sales team for follow-up\n   - Feature requests: Assign to product team for review\n\n### Workflow 2: Email Outreach\n\n1. **Send outreach email:**\n   - Template: See `EMAIL_OUTREACH_TEMPLATE.md`\n   - Track: Customer in outreach list\n\n2. **Capture response:**\n   - Parse email automatically\n   - Extract key points using LLM\n   - Log as feedback entry\n\n3. **Auto-assign:**\n   - Same as LinkedIn\n\n### Workflow 3: Demo Signups\n\n1. **After demo:**\n   - Send automated follow-up email with 3-question survey:\n     - \"What did you like?\"\n     - \"What was confusing?\"\n     - \"What's missing?\"\n\n2. **Capture responses:**\n   - Log as feedback entry with `source: 'demo'`\n\n### Workflow 4: Trial Users\n\n1. **During trial:**\n   - In-app feedback widget (always visible)\n   - Quick submit: \"What would make this better for you?\"\n\n2. **After trial ends:**\n   - Churn survey: \"Why didn't you convert?\"\n   - Log as feedback entry with `source: 'trial'`\n\n### Workflow 5: New Customers (First 30 Days)\n\n1. **Day 3:**\n   - \"How's setup going?\"\n\n2. **Day 7:**\n   - \"What's the biggest win so far?\"\n\n3. **Day 14:**\n   - \"What would make this 10x better?\"\n\n4. **Day 30:**\n   - Full onboarding survey\n\n---\n\n## Feedback Analysis\n\n### Weekly Report\n\n**Generate every Monday:**\n\n```sql\n-- Feedback by type\nSELECT feedback_type, COUNT(*) as count\nFROM feedback_entries\nWHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'\nGROUP BY feedback_type\nORDER BY count DESC;\n\n-- Top 5 feature requests\nSELECT feedback_text, COUNT(*) as request_count\nFROM feedback_entries\nWHERE feedback_type = 'feature_request'\n  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'\nGROUP BY feedback_text\nORDER BY request_count DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n\n-- Top 5 objections\nSELECT feedback_text, COUNT(*) as objection_count\nFROM feedback_entries\nWHERE feedback_type = 'objection'\n  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'\nGROUP BY feedback_text\nORDER BY objection_count DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n\n-- Conversion by feedback source\nSELECT \n  feedback_source,\n  COUNT(*) as total_feedback,\n  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'resolved' THEN 1 END) as resolved,\n  AVG(CASE WHEN status = 'resolved' THEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (resolved_at - created_at))/3600 END) as hours_to_resolve\nFROM feedback_entries\nWHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'\nGROUP BY feedback_source;\n```\n\n### Pattern Detection\n\n**Automatic alerting:**\n\n- If same feature request appears >3 times in 7 days: HIGH PRIORITY alert\n- If same objection appears >5 times in 30 days: STRATEGY review needed\n- If any feedback tag has >10 entries: ROADMAP consideration\n\n---\n\n## Action Triage\n\n### High Priority (Same Day)\n\n**Definition:**\n- Critical bug blocking core functionality\n- Feature request from paying customer with >$50k ARR\n- Competitive disadvantage (competitor has feature, we don't)\n\n**Action:** Assign to engineering, work immediately\n\n### Medium Priority (Within Week)\n\n**Definition:**\n- Feature request from >3 prospects\n- Usability issue affecting >5 users\n- Integration request from >2 prospects\n\n**Action:** Add to backlog, schedule next sprint\n\n### Low Priority (Backlog)\n\n**Definition:**\n- Nice-to-have feature from single user\n- Objections that can be addressed with better messaging\n- Enhancement ideas with unclear ROI\n\n**Action:** Defer indefinitely or after major milestones\n\n---\n\n## Close-the-Loop Automation\n\n### Feature Requests Resolved\n\n**When feature ships:**\n1. Find all feedback entries for that feature\n2. For each entry:\n   - Send email: \"You asked for X, we built it!\"\n   - Include: Demo video, screenshot, pricing note\n3. Track: How many convert after feature ships\n\n### Objections Addressed\n\n**When objection is resolved (via messaging or feature):**\n1. Find all feedback entries with that objection\n2. Send follow-up: \"We heard your concern about X. Here's how we addressed it...\"\n3. Track: Conversion lift\n\n---\n\n## Feedback Dashboard Metrics\n\n### Key Metrics to Track\n\n| Metric | Definition | Target\n|--------|------------|--------|\n| **Feedback Volume** | Total entries per week | 20+ (active outreach) |\n| **Response Rate** | % outreach that replies | 15%+ |\n| **Feature Request Rate** | % feedback that's feature requests | 30%+ |\n| **Objection Rate** | % feedback that's objections | 20% |\n| **Resolution Time** | Avg time to resolve feedback | 72h for high, 7d for medium |\n| **Close-the-Loop Rate** | % resolved feedback where we notified the customer | 80%+ |\n| **Conversion After Feature** | % customers who converted after their feature shipped | 25%+ |\n\n### Dashboard Views\n\n**View 1: Feed (Chronological)**\n```\n| Date | Source | Company | Type | Summary | Priority | Status |\n|------|--------|---------|------|---------|----------|--------|\n| Feb 1 | LinkedIn | ABC Pool | Pain Point | \"Too many spreadsheets\" | High | Reviewed |\n| Feb 2 | Email | XYZ Pool | Feature Request | \"Need QuickBooks integration\" | Medium | Planned |\n```\n\n**View 2: Top Requests (Ranked by Volume)**\n```\n| Feature | Requests | Revenue Impact | Priority | Status |\n|---------|----------|----------------|----------|--------|\n| QuickBooks integration | 12 | High ($50k ARR) | High | In Progress |\n| Mobile app offline | 8 | Medium | Medium | Planned |\n| Inventory tracking | 6 | Low | Low | Backlog |\n```\n\n**View 3: Objections by Theme**\n```\n| Objection | Count | Response | Conversion After Response |\n|-----------|-------|----------|--------------------------|\n| Switching cost | 15 | \"We import your data\" | 40% |\n| Pricing | 10 | \"ROI calculator shows $400/mo savings\" | 35% |\n| Complexity | 7 | \"Setup in <1 hour\" | 30% |\n```\n\n---\n\n## Outreach Templates\n\n### LinkedIn Outreach Template\n\n**Subject:** Route optimization for ABC Pool?\n\n```\nHey [Name],\n\nI saw ABC Pool is doing great work in [City].
