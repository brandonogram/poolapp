   - Summarize key findings
   - Identify 2-3 genuine conversation hooks
4. **Write DM** — 50 words personalized context + 50 words pitch
5. **Log in tracking sheet** — Prospect info, angles used, date sent

## 📊 PERSONALIZATION ANGLES (Examples)

### Angle Types:
1. **Company Growth** — "Saw you just expanded to 3 locations"
2. **Recent Post** — "Loved your post about pool safety education"
3. **Local Connection** — "We're also based in Delaware"
4. **Industry News** — "Congrats on being featured in [Publication]"
5. **Mutual Connection** — "We're both connected to [Name]"

## 💬 DM FRAMEWORK

**Structure:**
1. **Personalized Opening** (2-3 sentences based on research)
2. **Value Pitch** (1-2 sentences, tied to their business)
3. **Call to Action** (low-friction: "Quick 10-min demo?")

**Example (actual):**

> Hi [Name],
>
> Saw your recent post about hiring new technicians — congrats on the growth! Also noticed [Company] serves the Wilmington area, same as us.
>

Focus on professional achievements, recent content, or shared interests.
