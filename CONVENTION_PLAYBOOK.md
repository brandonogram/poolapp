## The Pitch (30 Seconds)

**Open with the pain:**
"How much time do your techs spend just driving between pools?"

**Drop the stat:**
"Most pool companies waste 25% of their fuel on inefficient routes. That's $4,000+ a year burning up in your trucks."

**The solution:**
"Pool App optimizes your routes automatically. Our customers save 2 hours per day per tech - that's 4-6 more pools you can service."

**The ask:**
"We have a show special - $79/month instead of $99. Want to see how it works?" [Show demo on phone]

---

## Key Value Props (5 Bullets)

1. **Route Optimization** - Save 38% on driving time = $4,000+/year in fuel
2. **More Stops Per Day** - Fit 4-6 extra pools per tech with optimized routes
3. **Chemistry Tracking** - Never miss a pH imbalance, reduce callbacks by 15%
4. **Same-Day Invoicing** - Send invoices from the truck, get paid 3x faster
5. **Easy Setup** - Import your customers, see optimized routes in 5 minutes

## Pricing Options

| Plan | Price | Best For | Key Selling Point |
|------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Convention Special** | $79/mo | Most buyers | "Only at this show - locks in $240/year savings" |
| **Founder Rate** | $59/mo | Early adopters | "Locked forever - only 12 spots left" |
| **Regular (Growth)** | $99/mo | Reference only | Don't sell this at the show |

### Pricing Strategy
- **Lead with Convention Special** ($79/mo) - it's the sweet spot
- **Founder Rate** ($59/mo) is for urgency - "Only 12 left, this price is locked forever"
- Both include 14-day free trial, no credit card required to start
- Annual option: 2 months free (effectively $66/mo)

### Payment Collection
- Send them to: **poolapp.vercel.app/convention** (scan QR code)
- Or collect email, we'll send signup link
- They get 14-day trial before any charge

## Common Objections & Responses

### "I already have routes figured out"
> "That's great - but are they optimized? We typically find 20-30% efficiency gains even for experienced operators. It takes 5 minutes to import your customers and see the difference. Want to try?"

### "My techs don't like new software"
> "Our mobile app is dead simple - it's basically Google Maps for pool routes. They open it, see the next stop, tap to log chemistry. That's it. No training needed."

### "$79/month is expensive"
> "Let's do the math: If you save just 30 minutes per tech per day, that's 10 hours per week. At $25/hour, that's $1,000/month in labor savings. Pool App pays for itself 12x over."

### "I need to think about it"
> "Totally understand. Two things: This $79 rate is only available at this show - it goes back to $99 next week. And there's no risk - 14-day free trial, cancel anytime. Why not try it for free and see?"

### "Does it work with [other software]?"
> "What are you using now? [Listen] We integrate with QuickBooks for invoicing, and we're adding more integrations based on customer demand. If you join as a Founder, you get direct input on what we build next."

### "I'm too small for this"
> "Actually, you're our ideal customer. Companies with 1-3 techs see the biggest percentage gains because there's no IT overhead. Our solo operators are saving $300-400/month."

### "I'm too big for this"
> "We have customers with 10+ techs. The savings scale - one customer with 8 techs is saving $35,000/year. Let's schedule a call to discuss an enterprise setup."

## Quick Math for Objections

|----------|------|---------------|
| Save 30 min/day/tech | 30 min x 22 days x $25/hr | $275/tech |
| Save 1 hr/day/tech | 60 min x 22 days x $25/hr | $550/tech |
| Save 10 mi/day in fuel | 10 mi x 22 days x $0.50/mi | $110/month |
| Reduce callbacks 10% | 2 callbacks/mo x $100 each | $200/month |

**Conservative estimate for 1 tech**: $400-600/month in value
**Pool App cost**: $79/month
