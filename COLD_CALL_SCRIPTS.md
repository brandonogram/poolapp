# PoolApp Cold Call Scripts
**Purpose:** Scripts for initiating sales calls beyond the demo
**Target:** Pool service owners who showed interest but didn't convert

---

## Pre-Call Research

**Before you dial, know:**
- Company name and owner's name
- Fleet size
- Current routing method
- Biggest pain point (from previous outreach or research)
- Average revenue per job
- Which demo content they engaged with (if they attended)

**Quick script prep:**
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from PoolApp. I helped set up a demo the other day. Following up to see if you had a chance to try it out."

---

## Script 1: Value-Based Follow-Up (After demo viewed)

**You:** "Hey [Name], following up on our PoolApp demo from the other day. Did you get a chance to try it out with your team, or did the timing not work out?"

**If they tried it:**
"Great to hear you! What did you think? Is there anything that would make PoolApp a better fit for your operation?"

**Listen:** They'll tell you what they liked/disliked
- **Key talking point:** Focus on what resonated (speed, simplicity, price)

**If they want more info:**
"No problem. I can send you a personalized ROI calculator showing your specific numbers, or we can schedule a call with our technical team to walk through any concerns."

**Transition if they're interested:**
"I'm glad it was helpful. I'd love to get you set up with an account so you can try PoolApp yourself - takes about 5 minutes and you'll have full access immediately. Want me to send you the login details now or schedule a follow-up call?"

---

## Script 2: Time-Sensitive Follow-Up (1 week later)

**You:** "Hi [Name], I know you're busy running routes, but I wanted to circle back briefly about PoolApp. Have you had any more time to think it over?"

**If they're still considering:**
"I totally get that route planning is the last thing on your mind at the end of a long day. Just wanted to keep it on your radar."

**Add value:**
"By the way - I've got some new customers saving real money with PoolApp. One company cut their route planning time by 75% and is saving over $800/month. That's money going right into their pocket."

**Question to gauge interest:**
"You mentioned earlier you were using Route4Me or spreadsheets - are you actively looking to make a change now, or just exploring options?"

---

## Script 3: Price Objection (Too expensive)

**If they say:** "It sounds expensive - we don't have the budget right now."

**You:** "I completely understand budget is top priority. That's exactly why PoolApp is priced at $39-79/month - not the enterprise pricing of Route4Me or Badger Maps that's $150+/month plus per-driver fees."

**Show the math:**
"For 10 routes, Route4Me would cost you about $225/month. PoolApp is $79/month - no per-driver fees, built specifically for pool services, and includes revenue tracking and chemistry alerts. You'd actually save $146/month by switching, plus prevent expensive callbacks. And PoolApp pays for itself in less than a month through the time savings alone."

**Offer a limited-time offer:**
"I'm confident you'll see the value quickly. How about this: I'll set you up with a free 30-day trial, full access, no commitment needed. At the end of 30 days, if PoolApp isn't saving you at least $500/month, you can cancel and I'll make sure you get a full refund. That's risk-free on you."

**Get a soft yes:**
"Would you be open to trying it out for 30 days? I can get that set up right now - takes about 5 minutes."

## Script 4: Current System Works Fine (Comfort objection)

**If they say:** "We're happy with our current process - spreadsheets and paper work fine."

**You:** "That's great to hear. A lot of our customers feel the same way - if it's not broken, why fix it?"

**Transition:**
"Here's what we're finding with companies like yours: As you grow beyond 15 or 20 routes, the complexity starts to add up. The spreadsheets that work fine today become overwhelming tomorrow. You're managing  get by."

**Highlight the pain point:**
"Your techs are spending hours every night trying to optimize routes manually. What happens when one of them is sick or goes on vacation? Does that work stop? With PoolApp, route optimization happens automatically 24/7, even if someone's out."

**Plant the seed for future:**
"I'm not saying you need to switch today. Just planting the seed that growth brings operational challenges, and PoolApp will be ready when you are."

## Script 5: Decision Maker is Busy

**If you reach the owner directly:**

"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from PoolApp. I've been trying to reach you to discuss how we could help optimize your route planning and save your team time. I know you're incredibly busy running a pool service, so I'll be brief."

**State your purpose quickly:**
"PoolApp is a route optimization tool built specifically for pool services - AI-powered, handles up to 50 routes for $39-79/month with chemistry alerts and revenue tracking. It's different from the enterprise tools that cost $200+ monthly with per-driver charges. I'd love  share a quick demo or send you some ROI numbers for your specific operation."

**Offer a no-pressure next step:**

"If you're interested in learning more, I can send you a personalized ROI calculator or schedule a call with our technical team. No pressure. Just let me know what works for you."

---

## Script 6: Voice Mail (Left a message)

**If they don't answer:**

"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from PoolApp again. I left a voicemail mentioning route optimization and how PoolApp could save you time and money on routes. When you have a moment, give me a call back or you can reach out to me through email. Thanks!"

## Common Objections & Responses

### "We need to talk to our partner/owner/boss"
**Response:** "Totally makes sense. PoolApp is a new tool for your operation. You should absolutely involve your team - owner, dispatchers, whoever handles operations. That's why we offer team accounts and make onboarding simple for your whole organization. Would you like me to set up a demo with your operations team as well?"

### "I don't have time right now"
**Response:** "I completely get it. Peak pool season is approaching and you're probably in the thick of it. Let me ask - would you be open to a brief 15-minute call this week just to see if there's a fit? No pressure, no commitment. If the timing doesn't work, we can reconnect when it does."

### "We use a custom system"
**Response:** "Good to hear that. Custom systems can work great up to a point - until they don't. But what happens when you want to add routes or bring on a new technician? Or when you have callbacks and need to adjust routes on the fly? With PoolApp, all of that takes a click or two - you get immediate re-optimization. We also offer a free trial so you can see it in action."

### "How much does it cost?"
**Response:** "PoolApp is $39-79/month for 1-15 routes, and $79/month for 16-50 routes. Compare that to Route4Me at $149/month base plus $15 per driver. You'd need  have 20+ routes before Route4Me even starts making financial sense. Plus PoolApp includes features Route4Me doesn't have - chemistry alerts, revenue tracking, technician management. You're paying for things you don't need."

### "I'll think about it / let me get back to you"
**Response:** "No problem at all. Take your time. I'm here whenever you're ready. Here's my contact info if you'd prefer to reach out that way: [Your Name], [Your Name], [Phone], [Email]."

## Closing Questions to Ask

After each call, these help move to next steps:

1. "What's your current routing method? How many routes do you run?"
2. "Who handles scheduling - you or a dispatcher?"
3. "How do you manage customer data and billing?"
4. "What's your biggest operational challenge right now?"
5. "If you could solve one problem with software, what would it be worth to you?"

## Tips for Success

**Don't push:**
Pool service owners are practical people. They don't like being sold to. Present value, answer questions, earn trust.

**Be a consultant, not a salesperson:**
Help them solve problems. Understand their specific challenges. Recommend what fits their situation.

**Speed vs thoroughness:**
Some calls need to be quick - "Got  minute?" calls. Others are deeper discovery calls.

**Always offer next steps:**
Don't hang up with "let me think about it." Always propose a clear next action - trial account, follow-up call, sending materials, or technical demo.
