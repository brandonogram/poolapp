## 🎬 OUTREACH TEMPLATES

### Cold Email Templates (3 variations)

**Template 1 (Pain-focused):**
Subject: [City] pool company wasting hours on route planning?

Hi [Name],

Running a pool service business means your day is already packed — scheduling, customer calls, actual pool work.

What if you could cut 10+ hours off your weekly planning time automatically?

PoolApp integrates with GoHighLevel to:
- Auto-optimize daily routes
- Reduce missed appointments by 90%
- Keep customers happy with ETAs

Most of our pool clients save $500+/week in recovered time.

Would you be open to a 5-minute demo?

Best,
Brandon

**Template 2 (Social Proof):**
Subject: Pool companies in [Area] are using AI to schedule better

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because we're helping pool service companies in [Area] streamline their scheduling.

Example: [Local Pool Company] saved 12 hours/week on route planning within 2 weeks of using PoolApp.

They integrated it with their existing GoHighLevel setup — no new systems to learn.

Want to see how it works?

Let me know 2-3 times you're free this week for a quick call.

Best,
Brandon

---

**Template 3 (Question-based):**
Subject: Question about [Company Name]'s scheduling

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How much time does your team spend each week planning routes and handling scheduling changes?

We built PoolApp specifically for pool service businesses — it auto-optimizes routes and reduces planning time by 80%.

If that sounds interesting, I'd be happy to show you a quick 10-minute demo.

Would you be open to that?

Best,
Brandon
