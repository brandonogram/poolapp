## The Hidden Costs Killing Pool Service Profits

Pool service companies are leaving thousands of dollars on the table every month. They just don't see it.

### The 3 Leaks

#### 1. Inefficient Route Planning ($6,000+/year lost)

**The Problem:**
Most pool services spend 2-3 hours every single night planning routes. They manually optimize by asking questions like:
- "Which customer goes after which?"
- "Can we group these jobs together?"
- "How do I minimize backtracking?"

It's mental math. They're staring at spreadsheets, maps, and customer lists—trying to fit pieces together.

**The Cost:**
- 2.5 hours/night × 22 nights = 55 hours/month
- At $100/hour (owner's time) = $5,500/month wasted
- Plus: 15 minutes "drive time" between jobs = 7.5 hours/month
- **Total: ~$6,000/month or $72,000/year**

**With PoolApp:**
- Route planning takes 5 minutes (AI optimization)
- Savings: 50+ hours/month saved × $100/hr = $5,000+/month saved

#### 2. Lost Revenue from Missed Jobs ($2,000-$6,000/year lost)

**The Problem:**
Using spreadsheets and manual tracking means jobs get missed. No invoice was sent. Customer forgot to mention filter change or equipment upgrade.

**The Cost:**
- Average: 2-3 missed jobs/month per technician
- Average revenue per job: $150
- Lost revenue: 3 jobs × $150 = $450/month per tech
- For 10 techs: $4,500/month or $54,000/year

**With PoolApp:**
- Real-time tracking means zero lost jobs
- Revenue tracking catches everything
- **Savings: $54,000/year**

#### 3. Expensive Callbacks ($10,000-$20,000/year lost)

**The Problem:**
Pool chemistry issues cause callbacks. pH too high = green pool → free acid wash = customer angry = lost job.

**The Cost:**
- Average callbacks: 2-3/month per technician
- Cost per callback: $400-600 (service visit + chemicals)
- For 10 techs: 8-20 callbacks/month = $4,000-$8,000/month
- **Total: $48,000-$96,000/year**

**With PoolApp:**
- Chemistry alerts catch issues BEFORE tech arrives
- Alerts: pH high, chlorine low, alkalinity off
- Prevents 40-60% of callbacks
- **Savings: $19,200-$38,400/year**

### Why This Matters Now

Pool service season is starting NOW (March-August). Companies making decisions about software, scaling, and hiring.

**If you wait until summer to evaluate:**
You've lost 4-5 months of potential savings. That's enough to hire 2-3 technicians or buy a new truck.

**The opportunity cost of waiting:**
- 4 months × $152,400 savings = $600,000+ in potential lost revenue
- That's enough to hire 2-3 technicians or buy a new truck
- Or it's pure profit you're leaving on the table

### The PoolApp Difference

**What Route4Me does:**
- Optimizes routes (good)

**What PoolApp does:**
- Optimizes routes (better AI, specifically for pools)
- Costs $39-$79/month (no per-driver fees)
- Includes revenue tracking
- Chemistry alerts (prevents callbacks)
- Technician mobile app
- Simple setup (5 minutes)
- Built specifically for pool services

**The choice isn't even close:**
You're paying 3-5x more money for a tool that does less, and you're still missing features that directly impact your bottom line.
