# PoolApp Sales Email Campaign
**5-email sequence for pool service companies**

## Email 1: Personalized Opener (Personalized, value-first)

**Subject:** Pool route optimization for [Company Name]

**Body:**

Hi [Owner Name],

I've been researching pool service companies in [City] and noticed [Company Name] growing fast – congrats on [number] service routes!

Your operation looks solid, but I'm curious about route planning. Are you using Route4Me, spreadsheets, or just "in your head"? Most companies I talk with spend 2-3 hours per night planning routes – time you could be billing more jobs.

We built PoolApp specifically for route optimization. Here's what it does:
- Auto-optimize routes based on traffic and job priority
- Track revenue in real-time ($0 wasted)
- Alert you to chemistry issues before callbacks
- Manage customer data and billing in one place

Pricing starts at $39/month. If you're interested in a demo or want to see how much time/money you could save, let me know.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Email 2: Comparison (PoolApp vs Route4Me)

**Subject:** PoolApp vs Route4Me for [Company Name]

**Body:**

Hi [Owner Name],

Following up on my previous email – I wanted to compare PoolApp with Route4Me, since that's what most pool services use.

**PoolApp ($39-79/month):**
- Route optimization: ✓
- Revenue tracking: ✓
- Chemistry alerts: ✓
- Customer management: ✓
- No per-driver seat charges
- Simple mobile app for technicians
- 5-minute setup

**Route4Me ($149/month base):**
- Route optimization: ✓
- Revenue tracking: ✗
- Chemistry alerts: ✗
- Customer management: ✗
- $15/month per driver (you'd pay ~$225/month for 15 routes)
- Setup takes 30+ minutes
- Enterprise-focused, complex UI

**Bottom line:** Route4Me is great for large fleets, but PoolApp is built for pool services. You get everything you need without the complexity or enterprise pricing.
