3. **Scheduling Efficiency:** Use drag-and-drop on the Schedule page to adjust routes in real-time

**Feature Tip of the Week:**

On the Schedule page, you can click and drag jobs to reschedule them instantly. This is perfect for handling last-minute changes, customer cancellations, or emergency service calls.

**Try it this week:** Next time a customer cancels or needs to reschedule, just drag the job card to a new time slot instead of calling them.

## Email 4: Week 2 Growth (Send 14 days after signup)

**Subject:** Ways to get even more value from PoolApp

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

You've been using PoolApp for two weeks now - great progress! I wanted to share some advanced tips that can help you scale your operation even more efficiently.

---

**Advanced Features to Unlock More Value:**

### 1. 🚨 Chemistry Alerts - Prevent Expensive Callbacks

Callbacks are one of the biggest costs for pool service companies. A single callback can cost $400-600.

PoolApp's chemistry alert system monitors:
- pH levels (too high or too low)
- Chlorine levels
- Alkalinity
- Cyanuric acid

**How to use:**
- Go to Customers → Click on any customer
- You'll see their "Chemistry History" section
- When levels are out of range, you'll get an alert
- Resolve the issue BEFORE sending a technician
- Save $500+ on every prevented callback

**Real example:** One customer we work with prevented 23 callbacks last year = $11,500 saved. That's nearly a year of PoolApp subscription!

### 2. 📊 Historical Reports - Optimize Your Business

PoolApp tracks every job forever. Use this data to make smart decisions:

**Revenue by Customer:** See which customers are most valuable (top 20% typically drive 80% of revenue)
- **Revenue by Technician:** Track who's your top performer
- **Service Frequency:** Identify customers needing weekly vs bi-weekly service
- **Seasonal Trends:** Plan for slow months and ramp up for peak season

**How to access:**
- Navigate to Dashboard → Scroll to "This Month" revenue chart
- Click on different time periods (week, month, year)
- Export reports to CSV for your accountant

### 3. 🚀 Multi-Route Assignments - Scale to Multiple Areas

If you expand to new territories, PoolApp handles it seamlessly:

**Create multiple route groups:**
- "North Side" - Technician A, B
- "South Side" - Technician C, D
- "East Suburbs" - Technician E, F

**Each technician sees only their assigned routes.** Clean separation, no confusion.

**How to set up:**
- Navigate to Routes → Click "Add Route Group"
- Name the group (e.g., "North Side")
- Assign technicians to that group
- Routes are only visible to assigned techs

### 4. 💰 Smart Route Optimization Settings

PoolApp's AI automatically optimizes, but you can fine-tune:

**Job Priority Weights:**
- Emergency repairs = Highest priority (auto-routes first)
- Regular service = Medium
- New installations = Lower

**Traffic Patterns:**
- Avoid school zones during 7-9 AM and 2-4 PM
- Prefer highways over residential streets when possible
- Account for known construction delays

**Maximize technician efficiency:**
- Route by geographic zone (not mixed)
- Minimize backtracking (avoid criss-crossing routes)
- Balance workload across techs (8 jobs each, not 12 for one and 4 for another)

**How to adjust:**
- Navigate to Routes → Click the gear icon "Optimization Settings"
- Set your preferences above

### 5. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Team Management - Delegate and Grow

As you add more technicians or office staff, PoolApp grows with you:

**Role-Based Access:**
- **Owner:** Full access to everything
- **Dispatcher:** Can view routes, assign jobs, see schedules
- **Technician:** Can only see their assigned jobs and customer details
- **Accountant:** Can access all financial reports and invoices

**How to add team members:**
- Navigate to Settings → Team
- Enter name, email, role
- They'll get an invite to download their app

**Keep your data secure:** Only authorized roles see sensitive information like pricing or profit margins.

**One recommendation for Month 2:**

📌 **Add More Customers**

Your revenue and efficiency scale directly with the number of pools you service. Each additional customer adds $[estimate] to your monthly revenue.

**Your current customers are doing well.** But is there an opportunity to add more?

**Questions to think about:**
- Are there new developments in your service area?
- Do you have referrals from current customers?
- Are your technicians underutilized (could handle more pools)?

**If you're ready to grow:** Adding just 5-10 more customers could add $[growth amount] to your monthly revenue. That's an additional $[annual growth] per year - more than paying for PoolApp for years.

**PoolApp scales with you.** Whether you have 5 routes or 50, we can handle it.

🚨 **Automated Invoicing**
