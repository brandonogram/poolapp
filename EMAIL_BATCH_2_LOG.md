Subject: Pool route optimization for [Company Name]

Hi [Owner Name if available],

I came across [Company Name] while researching pool services in [City] - [personalized detail about their company].

Quick question: How are you currently handling route planning? Spreadsheets, Route4Me, or just experience?

We built PoolApp specifically for pool services:
- AI route optimization (saves 2+ hours/day)
- Chemistry tracking (prevents callbacks)
- Revenue dashboard (no more lost jobs)
- $39-79/month (no per-driver fees)

If you're interested in a quick demo or want to see how much time/money you could save, just reply to this email.

Best,
Brandon
