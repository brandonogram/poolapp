Hook (30 seconds)\n\n**Script:**\n\n\"Hey [Name], thanks for taking 5 minutes. I'm going to show you how PoolApp saves pool service companies $300-500 per month on callbacks - that's $3,600-6,000 per year.\n\nThe reason this matters is that most pool service owners I talk to are losing money on callbacks from missed chemistry issues. You know that phone call at 7am: 'Hey, my pool is green.' That's $200-300 gone.\n\nPoolApp is the only software that prevents those callbacks before they happen. Let me show you how.\"\n\n**Visual:** Show PoolApp logo, tagline: \"Prevent callbacks. Save money. Grow.\"\n\n---\n\n## 2. Problem (60 seconds)\n\n**Script:**\n\n\"Here's what most pool service companies are dealing with:\n\n**#1:** You're using spreadsheets or paper to plan routes. That takes 2 hours every morning. You're driving inefficient routes, wasting gas and time.\n\n**#2:** You're not tracking pool chemistry. You're checking pH and chlorine, but you're not tracking trends. So you miss the warning signs.\n\n**#3:** You're getting callbacks. pH hits 8.4, chlorine drops to 0.8, and suddenly you're spending Saturday fixing a green pool. That's $200-300 in lost revenue.\n\n**#4:** You can't track revenue. You don't know which routes are profitable, which customers are worth keeping, and where you're losing money.\n\nThis is chaos. It's costing you time, money, and customers.\"\n\n**Visual:** Show chaotic spreadsheet, technician with clipboard, phone ringing at 7am, revenue graph going down.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Solution (60 seconds)\n\n**Script:**\n\n\"PoolApp fixes all of this. Three things:\n\n**First:** Automatic route optimization. You upload your pools, we optimize routes across your technicians. 2 hours of planning becomes 20 minutes.\n\n**Second:** Pool chemistry tracking. This is the killer feature. We track pH and chlorine levels over time, alert you when trends are bad, and prevent callbacks before they happen.\n\n**Third:** Revenue dashboard. You see exactly how much each route makes, which customers are profitable, and where to grow.\n\nAll for $39-79/month. No add-ons, no contracts.\"\n\n**Visual:** Show PoolApp dashboard with routes, chemistry tracking, revenue numbers.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Killer Feature - Chemistry Tracking (90 seconds)\n\n**Script:**\n\n\"Let me show you the chemistry tracking - this is what makes PoolApp different.\n\n**[Show customer list]**\nHere's your customer list. See this red alert? That's pH critically high at 8.4.\n\n**[Click on customer]**\nHere's the Johnson residence. Look at this chemistry history over the last 30 days.\n\n**[Show trend line]**\nSee how pH is trending up? 7.6, 7.8, 8.0, 8.2, 8.4. A spreadsheet won't catch this. PoolApp did.\n\n**[Show alert]**\nWe sent an alert 3 days ago: 'pH trending high - monitor closely.' Your technician checked it yesterday and added acid treatment.\n\n**[Show result]**\nNow pH is back to 7.4. No callback. No angry customer. No $200 lost.\n\n**[Show another customer]**\nHere's another one. Chlorine is low at 0.8. We alerted 2 days ago. Tech added shock treatment. Chlorine is now 2.5. Problem solved.\n\n**[Show dashboard stats]**\nThis month, we've caught 12 chemistry issues. That's 12 callbacks we prevented. At $200 per callback, that's $2,400 saved this month alone.\n\nNo other software does this. Route4Me doesn't know what pH is. OptimoRoute doesn't care about chlorine. We do.\"\n\n**Visual:** Show customer list with alerts, chemistry trend graph, alert notifications, before/after pH levels, dashboard stats showing callbacks prevented.\n\n---\n\n## 5. ROI (30 seconds)\n\n**Script:**\n\n\"So here's what you get:\n\n**Time savings:** 90 minutes/day on route planning = 7.5 hours/week = $375/week saved\n\n**Callback savings:** Prevent 2 callbacks/month = $400-600/month saved\n\n**Total:** $500-800/month saved\n\n**Cost:** $39-79/month\n\n**Net:** $400-700/month in your pocket\n\n**ROI:** 500-900% return on investment\n\n**Break-even:** 2 weeks\n\nThis pays for itself in less than two weeks. After that, it's pure profit.\"\n\n**Visual:** Show ROI calculator chart, time savings, money saved, net profit.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Close (30 seconds)\n\n**Script:**\n\n\"Here's what I recommend:\n\n**Step 1:** Start a 14-day free trial. No credit card required.\n\n**Step 2:** Upload your customer list. We'll help you get it set up.\n\n**Step 3:** Use it for 14 days. Track chemistry, optimize routes, see the savings.\n\n**Step 4:** If you like it, it's $39-79/month. If you don't, cancel - no harm, no foul.\n\nI'm confident you'll see the value in 2 weeks. Most of our customers do.\n\nReady to start your free trial?\"\n\n**Visual:** Show CTA button, pricing, free trial messaging.\n\n---\n\n## Objection Handling\n\n### Objection 1: \"I already use Route4Me\"\n\n**Response:**\n\"Route4Me is great for routing, but does it track pool chemistry? Does it alert you when pH is trending high? Does it prevent callbacks? Route4Me optimizes your routes. We optimize your routes AND prevent chemistry callbacks. That's the difference.\"\n\n---\n\n### Objection 2: \"I don't have time to learn new software\"\n\n**Response:**\n\"It takes 15 minutes to set up. Upload your customer list, assign to technicians, done. Your technicians can use it on their phones - no training needed. You'll save more time in the first week than you spend setting it up.\"\n\n---\n\n### Objection 3: \"$39-79/month seems expensive\"\n\n**Response:**\n\"One callback costs you $200. If we prevent just one callback per month, you're profitable. We typically prevent 2-3 callbacks per month. So you're making money, not spending it. Plus, you're saving 7.5 hours/week on route planning. What's your time worth?\"\n\n---\n\n### Objection 4: \"My technicians won't use it\"\n\n**Response:**\n\"It's a mobile app. They click 'start job,' record pH/chlorine, click 'complete.' That's it. No complex forms. Most technicians prefer it because they don't have to carry paper clipboards. They see their routes on their phone, get GPS directions, and get alerts. It makes their job easier.\"\n\n---\n\n### Objection 5: \"I need to think about it\"\n\n**Response:**\n\"I understand. Here's what I'll do: Start a free trial. Use it for 14 days. Track your time savings. Count the callbacks we prevent. At the end of 14 days, you'll have the data to make a decision. If it's not saving you money, cancel - no questions asked. Fair?\"\n\n---\n\n## Demo Checklist\n\n**Before Demo:**\n- [ ] Research prospect (company size, service area, current tools)\n- [ ] Prepare custom ROI calculation\n- [ ] Have demo account ready with realistic data\n- [ ] Test all features (nothing broken)\n\n**During Demo:**\n- [ ] Start on time\n- [ ] Keep to 5 minutes\n- [ ] Focus on chemistry tracking (killer feature)\n- [ ] Show ROI calculator\n- [ ] Handle objections confidently\n- [ ] Get commitment to trial\n\n**After Demo:**\n- [ ] Send follow-up email within 24 hours\n- [ ] Provide trial account login\n- [ ] Share ROI calculator with their numbers\n- [ ] Check in after 3 days\n- [ ] Check in after 7 days\n- [ ] Close to paid after 14 days\n\n---\n\n## Key Phrases to Use\n\n- \"No other software tracks pool chemistry\"\n- \"We prevent callbacks before they happen\"\n- \"One callback = $200.
