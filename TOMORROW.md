## 30-SECOND PITCH

"How much time do your techs spend just driving between pools?"

"Most pool companies waste 25% of their fuel on inefficient routes. That's $4,000+ a year burning up in your trucks."

"Pool App optimizes your routes automatically. Our customers save 2 hours per day per tech - that's 4-6 more pools you can service."

"We have a show special - $79/month instead of $99. Want to see how it works?"
